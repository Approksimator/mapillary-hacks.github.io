**A challenge to photo map Capitol Hill and collect useful map data for Seattle.**

From now until the end of June, we’re bringing together the Mapillary community in Seattle and students from UW in a challenge to unlock the zones of Capitol Hill. Anyone living in Seattle or passing through during this time is welcome to join the #CompleteTheMap challenge.  

While coverage in Seattle has come a long way, there are many gaps that remain. #CompletetheMap Berlin has demonstrated that bringing together the community to focus on a specific part of the city is a very effective way to improve coverage. These photos will enable a new round of map editing focused on street-level details like shop information, mobility access, and amenities. [Follow the action here](https://mapillary-hacks.github.io/leaderboard/seattle/).

### The Challenge
Capitol Hill and surrounding areas has been divided into a 5x5 grid. To participate in the challenge, simply capture streets and paths in each zone. The contributor with the most images in each zone when it is marked as complete will win the zone. The contributor who wins the most zones wins #CompleteTheMap Seattle. Prizes will be awarded to winners of three different zones, but we won't tell you which ones so capture as many zones as possible to increase your chances.
If you’d like to take part, subscribe to [our email updates](http://eepurl.com/cTGRQT), head into Capitol Hill and start capturing images. Good luck!

### The Rules

**How do I enter the challenge**

Anyone capturing within the grid will automatically participate in the challenge. You don’t need to sign up anywhere.

**The Grid**

We will be checking coverage every day and assigning a color to each zone that represents the coverage status for that area. Red will represent 50% or less of coverage, orange above 50% and green 100% (complete). Only images captured from day one of the competition (June 23rd) will be counted. 

**Rankings & Updates**

We’ll be maintaining a live page with the results that you can visit any time [here](https://mapillary-hacks.github.io/leaderboard/seattle/). In addition to this, we’ll be sending out email updates participants at the start and end of each week. You can opt in [here](http://eepurl.com/cTGRQT). As usual, you’ll be able to get updates on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mapillary) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/mapillary) as well.

**How to win**

The winner of each zone will be the contributor with the most photos in that area when the zone is marked as complete (goes green). The overall winner will thus be the one to collect the most zones by improving coverage in that area. The competition will end when all the zones go green or on July 31st, whichever comes sooner. 

To keep the challenge as fair as possible, we will make sure that photos taken in each zone are useful. When necessary, we’ll manually update the zone to make sure it accurately reflects the state of photo coverage in that area. You’re welcome to send in feedback to tell us which zones need to be adjusted.

**Invite Friends**

If you would like to invite your friends to take part in the challenge, all they have to do is capture within the grid area and they will automatically appear on the leaderboard. If they want to stay updated, make sure they subscribe to our email updates and follow the #CompletetheMap hashtag on Facebook and Twitter.

**And we're off!**

Charge your phones, get your action cameras out, and get ready to photo map Seattle! Have fun exploring the city. Let’s #CompleteTheMap!
